# JARVIS

My second project written for educational purposes.
JARVIS - pseudo artificial intelligence. Jarvis is based on JSON files; the main core used to interpret the context (not intelligent!) and additional branches with prepared answers, which are selected randomly.
To add a new function, complete the core and then the array of known functions in functions.py.
You can communicate with Jarvis via a microphone or as a string test.

Jarvis can:
- Say hello and talk (for expansion)
- Say the weather
- Search for information in Wikipedia
- Say how much more or less can an item cost (downloading data from ceneo.pl)
- Inform about date and time
